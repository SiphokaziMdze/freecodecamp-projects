        <section class="main-section" id="Front-end_Development">
            <header>
                <h2>Front-end Development</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                Front-end development focuses on the client-side of web development, dealing with the visual aspects and user interactions of a website or web application. Front-end developers use languages such as <code>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript </code>to create the structure, style, and behavior of web pages. <code>HTML</code> provides the basic structure of a webpage, <code>CSS</code> enhances its appearance and layout, while JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic content.
            </p>
            <p>
                Frameworks and libraries like <code>React.js, Angular, and Vue.js</code> are commonly used in front-end development to streamline development processes and enhance functionality. Front-end developers also need to ensure cross-browser compatibility and responsiveness to ensure optimal user experiences across different devices and screen sizes.
            </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Back-end_Development">
            <header>
                <h2>Back-end Development</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                Back-end development focuses on the server-side of web development, dealing with the logic, database management, and server configuration needed to power websites and web applications. Back-end developers work with server-side languages like <code>Python, Ruby, PHP, and Node.js</code>, as well as frameworks like <code>Django, Ruby on Rails, Laravel, and Express.js.</code>
            </p>
            <p>
                Back-end developers handle tasks such as user authentication, data processing, API integrations, and server maintenance. They interact with databases like <code>MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, </code>and others to store and retrieve data efficiently. Back-end development is crucial for building robust, scalable, and secure web applications that can handle complex business logic and user interactions.

        <section class="main-section" id="Fullstack_Development">
            <header>
                <h2>Fullstack Development</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                Full-stack development involves working on both the front-end and back-end aspects of web development. Full-stack developers have proficiency in both client-side and server-side technologies, allowing them to handle all aspects of building a web application. They have a holistic understanding of the entire web development process, from concept and design to implementation and deployment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Full-stack developers can take on various roles within a development team, contributing to different parts of a project as needed. They often have a broader skill set and can transition between front-end and back-end tasks seamlessly. Full-stack development offers versatility and flexibility, enabling developers to work on projects independently or as part of a team.

        <section class="main-section" id="Web_Design">
            <header>
                <h2>Web Design</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                Web design focuses on creating visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces for websites and web applications. Web designers use principles of graphic design, typography, and user experience (UX) design to design layouts, color schemes, navigation elements, and interactive components. They aim to create designs that are intuitive, accessible, and engaging for users.
            </p>
            <p>
                Web designers often work closely with front-end developers to translate design mockups into functional web interfaces. They use design tools like Adobe XD, Sketch, Figma, and Adobe Photoshop to create wireframes, prototypes, and high-fidelity designs. Web design plays a crucial role in shaping the overall look and feel of a website, influencing how users perceive and interact with the content.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Back-end frameworks like <code>Django, Ruby on Rails, Laravel, and Express.js</code> offer pre-built modules and libraries for handling common tasks in server-side development.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Other technologies and tools used in web development include version control systems like Git, package managers like npm and yarn, task runners like Gulp and Grunt, and code editors like Visual Studio Code and Sublime Text. Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, cloud platforms like AWS and Google Cloud, and containerization technologies like Docker are also integral to modern web development workflows.
